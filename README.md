# Vaccine Alerts

**Current # of users:** 4

Receive alerts daily on the percentage of Canadians who have received at least one dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine.

The script that is run periodically is included in this git repository, although I used WayScript to run the script every day at 7:30AM EST and Twilio to send
the percentage calculated in the script to all users.
